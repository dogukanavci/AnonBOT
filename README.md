# AnonBOT
<h2>Mission</h2>
This is a slack bot that enables the users in the same workspace to interact anonymously. Users can take advantage of all the Slack functionalities while keeping their identities anonymous. Upon receiving an anonymous message, a user can respond to it. This bot is designed to help people who have a hard time interacting with their colleagues or introverts.

<h2>User Guide</h2>
Following are the keywords:
exit  = deletes all the data of you on the system and closes the conversation

rec:  = Initializes or changes the person we are having a conversation with

        To start a conversation with someone anonymously, specify the full name of the person with the following format:               rec:Bob Dylan or rec:Michael Jordan Please note that the full name section is case sensitive
help  = Prints the instructions of how to use the bot

Let us send a message to Willy Wonka(assuming he is in our Slack Workspace):

> You are now talking to Willy Wonka
